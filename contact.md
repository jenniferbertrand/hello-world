# Get in Touch :)

I’m passionate about discussing research on digital health, motion analysis, and telehealth technologies. My expertise lies in experimental design, methods, and data-driven approaches for remote health assessments and movement analysis. I also consult on visual communications, including scientific data visualizations and presentation materials.
