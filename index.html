        <h2>&#128075; Hi and welcome to my research site!</h2>
        <p>
            I'm passionate about improving health outcomes through innovative research that blends motion analysis, digital health, and patient-centric care. With a background in both human-computer interaction and remote + online behavioral methods, my work has evolved to focus on providing better, more accessible healthcare tools for individuals living with chronic disease.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Postdoctoral Work</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a postdoctoral fellow, conducting research within the Department of Medicine at the University of Alberta. My work explores how digital health innovations, such as advanced motion capture technologies + wearables, can support and enhance physical assessments in telehealth settings. This research is designed to make assessments more accessible, particularly for individuals managing chronic conditions, improving both patient care and clinical outcomes.
        </p>

        <h2>PhD + MSc Work</h2>
        <p>
            Over the past several years, my MSc + PhD research has explored how human behavior and movement can be captured and analyzed in both in-person and remote settings. From kinesiology, to cognitive neuroscience, to visual perception, decision-making, and human-computer interaction, Iâ€™ve worked across multiple domains to enhance our understanding of the brain and behavior (+ their associated methods). &#128073;<a href="projects.html">View My Projects</a>
