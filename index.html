        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my personal research website! I am passionate about improving health outcomes through innovative research that blends motion analysis, digital health, and patient-centric care. With a background in both human-computer interaction and remote physical assessment, my work has evolved to focus on providing better, more accessible healthcare tools for individuals living with chronic disease.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Focus: Postdoctoral Work</h2>
        <p>
            Currently, I am conducting postdoctoral research within the Department of Medicine at the University of Alberta. My work explores how digital health innovations, such as advanced motion capture technologies, can support and enhance movement assessments in telehealth settings. This research is designed to make physical performance testing more accessible, particularly for individuals managing chronic conditions, improving both patient care and clinical outcomes.
        </p>

        <h2>Past Work</h2>
        <p>
            Over the past several years, my research has explored how human behavior and movement can be captured and analyzed in both in-person and remote settings. From home-based assessments of physical function using motion capture to creating methods for remote experimentation, Iâ€™ve worked across multiple domains to enhance our understanding of human movement and its applications to health.
