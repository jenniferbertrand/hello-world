## Remote Eye-tracking for Behavioral Research
**Overview**: In response to the pandemic, we adapted our behavioral research to fully remote settings by leveraging webcam-based eye-tracking technology. This innovation allowed us to conduct complex visual attention studies without in-person lab access. We tested the limits of remote methods and successfully captured decision-making processes, demonstrating that remote eye-tracking can produce reliable data across a wide range of participants in diverse home environments.

**Key Contributions**:
- Pioneered webcam-based eye-tracking for fully remote studies.
- Validated the technology's ability to capture decision-making data remotely.
- Enabled broader and more inclusive participant engagement during the pandemic.

**Methods**: Webcam-based eye-tracking, remote behavioral analysis, online data collection + experimentation.
